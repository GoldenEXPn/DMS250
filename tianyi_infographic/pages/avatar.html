                        This is my WeChat avatar. This is my most frequently used social software. I use this cute raccoon to relieve people's
                    agape toward socialism/communism: there must be a reason for this raccoon's draw into it! Not going too deep into the ideology struggle,
                    there are other reasons for choosing this avatar as my online visage. By choosing an animal as my avatar, I am able to perform various
                    social engineering: it's easier to ask for discounts. Therefore, it makes conversation less formal and perhaps more relaxing to some extent.
