                <p>I chose this selfie as a result of an exclusive method. 
                        This selfie is taken when I'm working on a customized keyboard (I sell them upon finishing). 
                        My pastime is playing around with electronic stuff: writing boring code, building dull keyboards, 
                        and sometimes playing around with my car. Occasional introspection suggests to me to socialize with people, 
                        yet I figured social behaviors to be exhausting and unpredictable. Normally people respond the same with the same input, 
                        but interaction usually ends in various situations. I wish to cross the boundary, to trade hearts with heart, 
                        to understand better so I can always make the right decisions.
