                    My motto is "A lioness will use all of her strength even when hunting a rabbit". Of course it doesn't solely apply to study. 
                    I believe if one's trying his best in doing something, good rest is a must. From one's sleep you can tell his/her attitude
                    toward life. In conclusion, I wish you use the same amount of effort trying to goto sleep as if you are trying to move steadily 
                    to your goal.
