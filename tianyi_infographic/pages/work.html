                    Attached is my selfie taken during my office hour for Stats 213. This is my second term working as a teaching assistant for this class, 
                    and I've been enjoying sharing our knowledge and communicating with students. I've been engaged with many conversations, both online and 
                    in person, and my job shaped me to a better communicator (still not a good communicator to my standard). I believe teaching should use various 
                    methods for “knowledge transfer”: examples and analogies, proof using different methods if necessary, and proper practices for reinforcing the idea. 
                    I'm still exploring a better way to deliver and shape my knowledge to fit into others' mindset.
